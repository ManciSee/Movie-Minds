<p align="center"><img src="./images/logo.jpeg" alt="logo" width="300"/></p>
Have you ever wished for an innovative way to uncover amazing movies that perfectly match your unique tastes? I introduce you to Movie Minds, the app designed to lead you to the discovery of new cinematic worlds, all starting from your own creativity!

**How It Works:**
1. **Enter Your Unique Plot:**<br/>
Do you have a fantastic plot in mind? Input it on Movie Minds! Your imagination is the key to unlocking a world of films that could capture your attention.
2. **Personalized Recommendations:**<br/>
This recommendation system analyzes your plot and suggests films that closely align with your concept.
3. **Matching Cover Images:**<br/>
Movie Minds not only shows you the titles but also the cover images of the recommended films.
4. **Visually Compare Plots:**<br/>
The system generates a visual image based on your plot and compare it with those generated by my recommendation system. See how well your creativity matches the recommended films and get inspired!

**Reliable Data Thanks to TMDb APIs:**<br/>
All movie data, from plots to cover images, is obtained through the reliable APIs of The Movie Database ([TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/)). I guarantee an accurate and up-to-date cinematic experience, providing a specifically curated dataset to ensure information quality.

**Replicate:**<br/>
Additionally, Movie Minds integrates the powerful Replicate APis ([Replicate](https://replicate.com/)) to further enhance the user experience. By leveraging models such as LLama2 and StableDiffusion, the system generates a plot based on user-input keywords; moreover, an image depicting this generated plot is also created. This feature not only streamlines the process of discovering relevant films but also adds a level of personalization to the recommendations.
